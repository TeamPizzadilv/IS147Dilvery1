Description: Our project is a pizza shop delivery/order system. You will be taken through the process of ordering food from a pizza shop 
which offers not only pizza but wings, pasta, deserts and drinks. You will enter your address, choose everything from crust to toppings for your
pizza, pick any amount of sides -pasta,wings- you want if any, be given the option of a desert or drink before being lead to checkout to ensure your order is correct. 
Once confirmed you will be given your total and after payment you will be given a time frame of when to expect your order.
